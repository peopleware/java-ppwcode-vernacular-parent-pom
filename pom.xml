  <!-- MAGIC MANTRA -->
  <!-- The following entries need to be repeated, and can not sensibly be inherited.
       The reason is, sadly, that Maven 2 has a built in, undocumented "feature" that appends the artifact id to a number of URL's and paths
       if those URL's or paths are inherited. The reasoning behind that is he use of inheritance inside multi-module projects.
       It seems that if you are using inheritance outside of multi-module projects, you are out of luck.
       At least, we are :-(.
       The entries here are calculated in the "calculation properties" higher. To avoid the inheritance
       trap, the definitions below need to be repeated in each (consecutive) child, as a magic mantra.

    <!-- The repository definition can be inherited from the parent pom for ppwcode projects:
         the repository path is not changed for child poms, and it "happens" to be the same
         for all our libraries as for our parent pom -->
